# RachitCaster
![Picture of the raycaster](/demo.png)
A retro-style raycaster written using HTMl 5 Canvas and pure Javascript.
- Features textures, a mini-map, procedural/maze generation, doors, fully implemented first person controller (including strafe and up/down mouselook), and more!
- Uses modern Javascript features such as classes, modules, JSDoc, PointerLock API, etc.

MAJOR WORK IN PROGRESS, THE CODE IS BEING REFACTORED TO AN OBJECT BASED MODEL WITH COMMENTS (JSDOC) IN `src/`

# Credits
Much of the work here is inspired by Lode Vandevenne's excellent tutorials on raycasting.
